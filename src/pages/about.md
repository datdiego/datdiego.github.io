I'm a **Senior Data Scientist** with over 10 years of experience applying statistical modeling, machine learning, and AI systems to high-stakes domains including cybersecurity, transportation operations, and mission-critical systems. I specialize in translating ambiguous business problems into measurable models, deploying production ML pipelines, and communicating complex results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
